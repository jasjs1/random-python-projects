# random-python-projects

Random Python Projects is a library of projects for beginners who are learning how to learn Python.

Inside of the 'projects' folder, there you will find three teirs. Beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Inside of those folders, there will be a collection of projects that will help you learn Python. If you find a project as too difficult, go to another file in that folder or go to the folder down. **If you are a complete beginner, watch a course before using this. This is not a guide on how to learn python, this is a tool to help you with projects to help your understanding of python in making projects of your own.**
